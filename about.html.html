        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>BACKGROUND</b><br>
            The establishment of Muteesa I Royal University (MRU) was a dual inspiration and motivation by Ssabasajja Kabaka Muwenda Mutebi II and promoted by the Executive Committee of the Buganda Kingdom, headed by the Katikkiro. The basic preparatory work was carried out by the Buganda University Task Force (BUTF), which was inaugurated by Katikkiro of Buganda on 8th June 2004 and submitted its final report on 2nd December 2004. The BUTF’s report was followed up by the formation of MRU Implementation Committee, which was succeeded by the Interim University Council on 1st June 2005 to serve for one year, and subsequently, a fully fledged University Council inaugurated by the Chancellor.<br>
             The National Council for Higher Education on 5th April 2005 Licensed Muteesa I Royal University to operate as a private University. The University opened its doors to the public on 01-10-2007. The Buganda Monarch is responsible for the establishment of many various academic institutions.<br>
<b style="text-align: center;">NAME OF THE UNIVERSITY</b><br>
The University’s name is Muteesa I Royal University in recognition of a monarch of great vision, Kabaka Muteesa I of Buganda (1856-1884), whose invitation of Missionaries through a letter to Queen Victoria of England is generally regarded as the genesis of modern formal education in Uganda.<br>
<p  style="text-align: center;"><b>VISION</b><br>
A leading University responding to contemporary challenges through teaching and learning, research and technical guidance.<br>
<p  style="text-align: center;"><b>MISSION</b><br>
To provide training, research and technical guidance responsive to social – economic needs</p>
<p  style="text-align: center;"><b>UNIVERISTY PHILOSOPHY</b><br>
To put a premium on the promotion of a holistic and generative type of education, characterized by a dynamically diversified curriculum and an eclectic mode of tuition.<br>
 In this connection, the most prized intellectual values are fostered, and these include quality teaching and learning, research-mindedness, initiative, and resourcefulness, as seen in the context of rapidly changing conditions of life and the world of work.
